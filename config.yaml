sampling_rate: 22050 # this is the sr that tifresi and librosa (at least in librosa.load) use by default


# STFT
# with the current params we will train on images of size x = 256 and y = 257
spec_x_len: 8192 
eval_spec_x_len: 65536  # need bigger specs when trying to inspect them in the wandb board (but spec_x_len has to be quite small or else memory will run out)
stft_num_channels: 512
stft_hop_size: 32
# ACHTUNG: 
# the following has to hold in order to have reconstructability: stft_num_channels / hop_size >= 4
stft_min_val: -50 # = minimum allowed value of the spectrogram (in dB), this value was tweaked s.t. the output
                  # of spec_to_preprocessed_spec is not a noisy mess (which it becomes if you lower this value)
                  # and is also not too quiet (which it becomes if you increase this value)
# ACHTUNG: 
# abs(stft_min_val) has to be <= stft_dyn_range_upper_bound since in spec_to_preprocessed_spec
# we first clip the spec to the range [stft_min_val, 0] and then we shift it by abs(stft_min_val)
# and then in to_01 divide by stft_dyn_range_upper_bound and if abs(stft_min_val) >
# stft_dyn_range_upper_bound then the resulting spec could end up containing values greater than 1.
